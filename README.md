# Electronic Skills 1: Single LED
In this assignment you learn how to use a breadboard for creating a simple circuit with a single LED.

## Instructions
Read all of the instructions before starting the assignment.
1. Start by watching the following videos 
  * Introduction to breadboards: https://youtu.be/oiqNaSPTI7w 
  * Introduction to LEDs: https://youtu.be/GbyxKEXU5iQ  
  * Introduction to resistors: https://youtu.be/D04p1FjgtIE  
1. Get the following materials:
  * A breadboard (from your teacher)
  * A LEDs
  * A 330 Ohm resistor
  * Hookup wire
  * Small ziplock bag - for storing your electronic components  
1. For this assignment you will also need a DMM and a functional battery pack or power supply.
1. Label your breadboard with your name using a piece of masking tape (do NOT write directly on the breadboard and do NOT peel off the sticky backing on the breadboard).
1. Using a DMM test your battery pack, resistor and LED. 
1. Prepare your DMM by attaching leads to the probes (See picture).
